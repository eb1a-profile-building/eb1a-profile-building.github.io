- **U.S. Department of Commerce Research Library** - Through selecting the right open access journal
- **U.S. university institutional repositories (.edu commons)** - Manual submission through reputed co-authors

### European & International Public Research Platforms through targeted opena acess Journals

## Service Availability & Geographic Scope

At this time, this research mentorship and publication support service is **available only to clients who are physically based in**:

- **New York City (NYC) Metropolitan Area**
- **San Francisco Bay Area**

This geographic limitation is due to:

- The **current travel schedule and on-site availability of Shivgan Joshi who is based out of Indore MP India**,  
- **Mentor availability and coordination constraints**, and  
- The fact that this service **requires one or more in-person working sessions** to ensure effective research planning, manuscript review, and academic integrity oversight.

These limitations are operational in nature and reflect the Service Provider’s commitment to maintaining quality, responsiveness, and effective collaboration.

Availability may expand to additional regions in the future, subject to changes in travel plans, mentor capacity, and operational considerations, at the sole discretion of the Service Provider.
